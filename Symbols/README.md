# MASAM — Symbolic Annotations of Meaning

This folder contains sacred symbols and annotation marks designed to represent conceptual relationships within the Kingdom of Meaning.

## Purpose:
To simplify note-taking, deepen understanding, and ritualize the act of thinking.  
Inspired by mathematical notation, poetic glyphs, and architectural symbolism.

## Symbol Guide:
- ⨀ — Central concept  
- ⌁ — Related concept  
- ⧉ — Complementary concept  
- ⧋ — Opposing concept  

These symbols are part of the MASAM system, co-authored by Tahaamer 👑 and Sayenegar 🕊, and are intended for use in sacred texts, architectural diagrams, and poetic manifestos.

## Status:
This symbolic system is under active development and may evolve over time.
